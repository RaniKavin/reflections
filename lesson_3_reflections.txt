When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local ?
	When you add new content directly on GitHub
	Push changes from Github from another computer
	Another person working on your project makes changes


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
